    "LLM": "These are the Answers:\n1. You spoke with a moderate level of confidence, but there were moments where you seemed uncertain.\n2. The content was somewhat interesting, but it lacked depth and specific details, and did not fully follow the guidelines provided.\n3. 5\n4. 4\n5. You are an individual with basic presentation skills, and you performed well in introducing the topic, but struggled to provide engaging and detailed information.\n6. You are a potential fit for the role, but you performed poorly in showcasing your unique strengths and qualifications.\n7. You are different from others in your ability to introduce new tools, but you performed poorly in highlighting what sets you apart from others.\n8. You bring a basic understanding of the tool and its potential benefits to the role, but you performed poorly in demonstrating how you can effectively utilize and promote it.\n9. The speech had a loose structure, starting with an introduction, transitioning into a brief explanation, and concluding with a vague call to action.\n10. You maintained a generally consistent tone, but your delivery speed was often rushed, and you could have benefited from varying your volume to add emphasis to key points.\n11. The quality of research for the topic was limited, and the speech lacked proper citations and credible sources to support the claims made about the tool. The depth of knowledge was also superficial, and more specific examples and details would have strengthened the presentation. Overall, the research and preparation for the topic seemed inadequate.\n12. I was not fully convinced by your overall speech on the topic, as it lacked persuasive power and failed to effectively demonstrate the tool's value and benefits. While you showed some potential, the presentation was not engaging or memorable, and I would need to see more to consider you for the job or opportunity."
